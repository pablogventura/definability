Installation instructions for the Sage packages in this directory:

1. In a Sage Notebook cell (or at the unix shell without %sh) enter

   %sh
   /path/to/sage -i http://math.chapman.edu/~jipsen/sagepkg/univ_algebra-yyyymmdd.spkg

   # replace "path/to" with your path and "yyyymmdd" with date of latest version
   # depending on your setup, you may need to be superuser or prefix with sudo 

2. (Optional) In a Sage Notebook cell enter

   %sh
   /path/to/sage -i http://math.chapman.edu/~jipsen/sagepkg/minion-20110325.spkg

   (Note: On an Apple Mac you may have to install Minion manually from 
    minion.sourceforge.net and put bin/minion into SAGE_ROOT/local/bin )

3. In a Sage Notebook cell enter

   %sh
   /path/to/sage -b

4. On the Action menu of the Sage Notebook select "Restart Worksheet"


5. To see if the installation works, try the following commands:

   prover9(["x=x"],["x=x"],2,2)

   prover9(["x=x"],["x!=x"],2,2)

   FOclass.FOclasses

   a = all_lattices(5)

   SI(a)

   b = fotheories.Lat.find_models(4)

   #show_posets(b) # no funciona porque no tienen uc los elementos de b

   Con(b[0])         # this assumes the Java Runtime Environment is installed

   Hom(b[0],b[1])    # this assumes you installed the Minion package

For a full list of commands, see the python code in

$SAGE_HOME/devel/sage/sage/logic/UA.py

The software installed above (prover9/mace4, uacalc, minion) is placed into 
$SAGE_HOME/local/bin (look for files/folders starting with ua or minion)
