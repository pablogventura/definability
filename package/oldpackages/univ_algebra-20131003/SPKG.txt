= UA: Universal Algebra spkg =

== Description ==

The UA.spkg is a Sage package that contains several software components 
useful for calculations in Universal Algebra

Prover9 is an automated theorem prover for first-order and equational logic, 
and Mace4 searches for finite models and counterexamples. The LADR libraries
contain several commandline programs useful for translating input/output into
other formats, and for removing isomorphic copies from a list of models.
See http://prover9.org

The Universal Algebra Calculator (R. Freese, E. Kiss, M. Valeriote) is an
interactive Java program for analyzing a finite algebra. In this spkg
it is used noninteractively. See http://uacalc.org

were all constructed) are distributed under the terms of the GNU General
